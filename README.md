# Istio Service Mesh Workshop:
Welcome to the [Istio Service Mesh Workshop](https://minasys.github.io/istio-service-mesh-on-eks/)! This hands-on workshop is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of Istio, the open-source service mesh that provides a way to control how microservices share data with one another. Below you will find an overview of the key topics we'll cover, aimed at equipping you with the skills needed to deploy, manage, and secure a microservices architecture on Kubernetes using Istio.

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, we will delve into the following key aspects of Istio:
* **How Istio Works:** Get to grips with the fundamentals of Istio, learning how it integrates with Kubernetes to manage the interaction between microservices.
* **Traffic Management:** Discover Istio's powerful traffic routing and control capabilities which allow for advanced deployment strategies and intelligent routing.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Learn how Istio enforces security policies and controls access between services, ensuring secure communication.
* **SSL/TLS Certificates with ACM Private CA:** We'll show you how to leverage AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Private Certificate Authority (CA) to manage SSL/TLS certificates in Istio.
* **Integration with Prometheus and Grafana:** Gain insights into integrating Istio with Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Grafana for visualizing those metrics.
* **Monitoring and Tracing:** Get hands-on experience with Jaeger for tracing and Kiali for observability to understand how your services are performing and interacting.

Each topic is packed with theoretical knowledge and practical exercises to help you understand and implement Istio's features in real-world scenarios.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:
* Understand the core concepts of service meshes and how Istio fits into the microservices ecosystem.
* Configure Istio components and custom resources for traffic management and security.
* Secure your service mesh and manage encryption with ACM Private CA.
* Set up observability tools to monitor, trace, and visualize service metrics and flows.

## Who Should Go Through It
This workshop is intended for:
* Developers and system architects who want to understand Istio and implement service mesh in their Kubernetes environments.
* DevOps professionals who are looking to enhance the reliability and security of their microservices architecture.
* Anyone with a foundational knowledge of Kubernetes and microservices looking to expand their skill set with service mesh technology.

We look forward to guiding you through the world of Istio and helping you to transform the way you build, deploy, and secure microservices with Kubernetes.
